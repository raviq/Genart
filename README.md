Genart is a collection of small, self-contained programs that produce generative art through random walks, geometric recursion, and spatial distinctions. Each script explores a different algorithmic approach to visual emergence — from Brownian-motion-style wandering to spiraling nautilus forms to walkers that react to bounded regions on a canvas.

## Gallery of Scripts

### `main.py` — Random Walking Artist

A turtle executes repeated random walks from the origin. Each walk picks a random pen and fill color, takes 1 000 steps of random angle (±90°) and random distance, then returns home to start again. The result is a dense, organic burst of color against a black background.

```
python main.py
```

### `artist.py` — Random Walking Artist (Rainbow Variant)

Similar to `main.py` but recolors on every single step (5 000 per walk) instead of once per walk, producing a denser, more chromatic output on a 1000×1000 canvas. This is the script that generated the image above.

```
python artist.py
```

### `artist.lisp` — Random Walking Artist (Common Lisp)

A pure Common Lisp port of the random-walk artist that renders directly to a framebuffer using Bresenham's line algorithm — no GUI or Turtle dependency required. Outputs a PPM image and optionally converts it to PNG via ImageMagick.

```
sbcl --load artist.lisp
```

This will produce `artist.png` (or `artist.ppm` if ImageMagick is not installed).

### `nautilus.py` — Nautilus Spiral

Draws a nautilus-like figure by repeatedly drawing a square, rotating by a small angle (10°), and scaling down by a factor of 0.97. The cumulative effect of 108 iterations creates an elegant logarithmic spiral.

```
python nautilus.py
```

### `rwcross.py` — Random Walker with Spatial Distinctions

Inspired by George Spencer-Brown's *Laws of Form*, this script introduces **distinctions** — bounded rectangular regions on the canvas. A walker roams freely and changes color when it crosses into or out of a distinction, making the invisible boundaries visible through the walker's trail. The walker is also bounded to a 600×600 area and redirects toward the origin when it strays too far.

```
python rwcross.py
```

> **Note:** This script uses Python 2 syntax (`print` statements, `xrange`). To run on Python 3, replace `print '...'` with `print('...')` and `xrange` with `range`.

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Required by | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **Python 2 or 3** | all `.py` scripts | [python.org](https://www.python.org/) |
| **Turtle** (stdlib) | `main.py`, `artist.py`, `nautilus.py`, `rwcross.py` | Included with Python |
| **NumPy** | `rwcross.py` | `pip install numpy` |
| **SBCL** | `artist.lisp` | [sbcl.org](http://www.sbcl.org/) |
| **ImageMagick** *(optional)* | `artist.lisp` (PPM → PNG) | [imagemagick.org](https://imagemagick.org/) |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/raviq/Genart.git
cd Genart

# Run any script
python artist.py        # rainbow random walks (Turtle GUI)
python nautilus.py       # nautilus spiral (Turtle GUI)
python main.py           # simpler random walks (Turtle GUI)
sbcl --load artist.lisp  # headless render to PNG
```

The Turtle-based scripts open an interactive window — close it to exit, or press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

## How It Works

All scripts share a common foundation: **random walks** driven by uniformly distributed angles and step lengths. The artistic variation comes from how each script layers color, geometry, and spatial logic on top of that core idea.

The **Lisp version** is notable for being entirely self-contained — it implements its own framebuffer, Bresenham line rasterizer, and PPM encoder without any external libraries, producing headless output suitable for batch generation.

The **distinctions** in `rwcross.py` add a conceptual layer: the walker's color change reveals the topology of invisible boundaries, turning a simple random walk into a form of spatial exploration and mark-making.

## Parameters to Tweak

| Script | Parameter | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `main.py` / `artist.py` | `steps` | Number of steps per walk (more = denser) |
| `main.py` / `artist.py` | distance arg (`5`) | Maximum step length |
| `nautilus.py` | `N=108` | Number of iterations |
| `nautilus.py` | `A=10` | Rotation angle per iteration |
| `nautilus.py` | `k=0.97` | Scale factor (< 1 shrinks, > 1 grows) |
| `artist.lisp` | `*steps*`, `*num-walks*` | Walk length and count |
| `rwcross.py` | `Distinction(x, y, side)` | Position and size of boundary regions |
